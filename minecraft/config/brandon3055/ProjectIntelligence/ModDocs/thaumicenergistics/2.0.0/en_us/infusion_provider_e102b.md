###### Infusion Provider
The Infusion Provider is a block that will provide the Essentia stored in a ME System to a Infusion Alter. It acts just like a jar, so must be placed in range of the Alter. This also means that it can work with other blocks that require Essentia, for example, you can attach §stack[thaumcraft:essentia_output]{size:10} Emptying Essentia Transfusers to the block to provide Essentia to a Thaumotorium.
