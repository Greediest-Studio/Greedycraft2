###### Essentia Terminal
The Essentia Terminal allows you to view Essentia stored in a ME System, and manually insert and extract Essentia from a ME System. Simply left click with a §stack[thaumcraft:phial,1,32767]{size:8} phial (or stack of phials) to fill/empty the phial(s).


§stack[thaumicenergistics:arcane_terminal]{size:32}
###### Arcane Terminal
The Arcane Terminal is similar to a §stack[appliedenergistics2:part,1,360]{size:8} ME Crafting Terminal but has extra slots to allow it to function as an §stack[thaumcraft:arcane_workbench]{size:8} Arcane Workbench.
There are 6 slots to the right of the crafting output slot that allows §stack[thaumcraft:crystal_essence,1,0,{Aspects:[{amount:1,key:"ignis"}]}]{size:8} Vis Crystals to be placed for an Arcane Crafting Recipe.
The slot sticking out of the right side of the GUI is an upgrade slot that allows placing an §stack[thaumicenergistics:upgrade_arcane]{size:8} Arcane Charging Upgrade. The Arcane Charging Upgrade allows the Arcane Crafting Recipe to draw Vis from nearby chunks, instead of the current chunk.
