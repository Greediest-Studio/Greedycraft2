Ender IO is a full-sized tech-mod. Listing all its features could fill whole books, and because all programmers are lazy when it comes to documentation, those books don't exist.

But don't despair! We aren't completely heartless (only mostly)---there *is* some documentation:

§table{width:100%,render_cells:false}
| :- | :-------------------- |
| §stack[minecraft:book]{size:18,enable_tooltip:false} | There are tooltips on our machines and items. In many cases holding **Shift** will show even more information about a block or item. |
| §stack[minecraft:knowledge_book]{size:18,enable_tooltip:false} | There are recipes in JEI. Just look up how an item is made ("R") or used ("U"). This also works for energy (µI), Dark Steel Upgrades, all of Ender IO's machines, filling containers in tank etc. |
| §stack[minecraft:bookshelf]{size:18,enable_tooltip:false} | Some information is available on our §link[https://github.com/SleepyTrousers/EnderIO/wiki]{alt_text:"WIKI"}. It is not very much and most is targeted towards other mod developers and modpack makers. |
| §stack[minecraft:writable_book]{size:18,enable_tooltip:false} | Oh, there also is **this** documentation. |
