Don't want to risk incurring the wrath of the Enderman by killing the Ender Dragon, but you still want to get your hands on a dragon egg?
No problem!
This mystical device allows you to extract an egg from the Ender Dragon without killing her!
To get started, simply craft this item and right-click the end portal with it (in the end)
The process will begin immediately.
Note: This may anger the enderman just a little, but they will get over it. It's not like you're killing the dragon after all.
