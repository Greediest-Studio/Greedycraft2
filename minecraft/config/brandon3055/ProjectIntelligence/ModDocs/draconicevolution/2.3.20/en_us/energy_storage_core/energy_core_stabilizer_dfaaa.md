Stabilizers are an essential part of the core. They, well... stabilize it.

If you're building a tier 1-4 core, this is as simple as placing 4 stabilizers around the core within 16 blocks.

However, if you're building a higher tier core, you will need advanced stabilizers. These are simply 9 regular stabilizers in the configuration shown below.

Once you have at least 1 stabilizer setup correctly, you can right-click it to once again open the energy core GUI. At this point, you will want to turn off the build guide if you have it on.

You can now also see the status of the core. If you have built the structure correctly, the core status should say "Valid".
Once you have completed the stabilizers you should then be able to activate the core.

Note that the stabilizers can be placed either on the horizontal or vertical plane.

Next step is to setup the energy pylons. §link[draconicevolution:energy_storage_core/energy_pylon]{alt_text:"Click here to go to the energy pylon page."}
