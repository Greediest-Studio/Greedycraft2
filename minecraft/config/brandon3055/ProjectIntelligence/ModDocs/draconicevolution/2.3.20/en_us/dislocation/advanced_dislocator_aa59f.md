Learning how draconic powers interact with the powers of the endermen, you have created the ultimate teleporter.

You can now store up to 100 locations and use the endermen’s own pearls as fuel.

This device can teleport you extreme distances, even across dimensions, at will.

Hold shift and right-click to open the GUI. Most functionality should be self-explanatory.

On the left is the destination list. Each destination has a lock button that prevents you from accidentally overwriting or deleting it.

Right-clicking a destination in the list will teleport you to it without actually selecting the destination.

On the right, starting from the top, you have the following: information about the selected destination, an option to rename the selected destination, an option to change the selected destination to your current coordinates, and an option to delete the selected destination.

Under that is the fuel, an option to teleport to the selected destination, an option to add your current location as a new destination, and an option to add Ender Pearls from your inventory to be used as fuel (hold shift and click to add a stack at a time).

While holding the dislocator, you can also hold shift and scroll to cycle through the destinations without opening the GUI.

You can even teleport other players and mobs by left-clicking them! Players must be holding shift to give their consent to being teleported and mobs cannot be teleported across dimensions.

It is possible to transfer locations between dislocators. Simply place an advanced dislocator and a basic or another advanced dislocator in the first and second slots of a crafting grid to transfer a location from the dislocator in slot 1 to the dislocator in slot 2.

When transferring from a basic to advanced dislocator, the location will be given the name "*Copy*". When going from advanced to basic, the currently selected location in the advanced dislocator will be set as the bound location in the basic dislocator.
