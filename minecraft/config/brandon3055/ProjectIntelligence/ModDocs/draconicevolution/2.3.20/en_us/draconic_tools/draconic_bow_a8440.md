§rule{colour:0x606060,height:3,width:100%,top_pad:0}
The bows in Draconic Evolution are very powerful with many different configurable settings.

§616M max RF - Upgradable to 256M.

§6Arrow Damage: base 3 - Upgradable to 9

§6Arrow Velocity: base +200% - Upgradable to +500%

§6Auto Fire Mode
Will automatically fire when the bow is fully charged.

§6Explosion Power
Allows you to make your arrow explosive.
Max power is equivalent to TNT.

§6Arrow of Draconic Fire
Switch to firing an arrow composed of pure Draconic energy! 
This is essentially the same as infinity but also increases damage and allows for some other features.

§6Shock Wave Power
This creates a shockwave that deals damage similar to an explosion but more powerful and doesn't damage blocks.
Only available with Arrow of Draconic Fire.

§6Magnification
Allows you to zoom in on the target to increase your accuracy.

§aInfo
Damage is calculated by multiplying arrow velocity with arrow damage with some randomness involved.

The energy required per shot is calculated by multiplying damage, velocity and explosion power.
This means that just setting all 3 to maximum will require an enormous amount of power per shot.

Shock Wave is only compatible with Arrow Of Draconic Fire, while Explosion Power is NOT compatible with Arrow Of Draconic Fire.
