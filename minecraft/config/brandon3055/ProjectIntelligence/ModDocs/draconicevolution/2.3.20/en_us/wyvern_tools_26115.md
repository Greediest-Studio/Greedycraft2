The Wyvern tool set is the first step on the journey towards the ultimate tools!

The wyvern tools have many advantages over vanilla tools.

§6§n RF Powered §r

§6§n Adjustable Mining Speed §r
Not only are these tools faster than vanilla but it is also possible to adjust their speed.
One of the biggest issues with fast tools is it can be really easy to destroy more blocks than intended which can be a big issue when, for example, working in sensitive areas of your base.
This helps solve that issue.

§6§n 5 Config Profiles §r
Having to open a GUI and make changes every time you want adjust say the mining speed or AOE can be annoying.
To fix this, each of these tools has 5 configurable profiles which you can easily switch between using a keybind (Default is Backslash "\").
These profiles can also be renamed for easier identification.

§6§n Area of Effect Tools and Weapons §r
All of the tools and weapons have AOE functions. The mining tools also have the option to enable an overlay that shows what blocks are covered by its AOE. 

§6§n AOE Safe Mode §r
This is a feature with all of the mining tools. When enabled the tool will check for any tile entities (e.g. machines) within its range.
If it finds any it will not break any blocks and will instead give you a warning.
This is a good way to avoid say... accidentally decimating your processing machines or your ME system when you get home from a mining trip.

§6§n Higher Attack Damage §r

§6§n Tools and weapons can be upgraded! §r
