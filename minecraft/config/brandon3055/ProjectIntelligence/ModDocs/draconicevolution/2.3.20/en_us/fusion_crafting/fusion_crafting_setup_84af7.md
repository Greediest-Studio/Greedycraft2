##### §nGetting started with fusion crafting

The setup process is actually fairly simple.
Just place down a Fusion Crafting Core, then place Fusion Crafting iInjectors anywhere you like to the north, south, east, west, above or below the core.
All injectors need to be at least 1 block away from the core and can be offset in any direction on their axis by 1 block.

That may sound a little confusing, so take a look at the image below.
Each glass block represents a valid location for an injector.

As you can see from the above image, injectors can be placed up to 16 blocks away as long as they are within the area shown and pointing at the core with no obstructions.

Something to note about Fusion Crafting: it does not matter how many injectors you have as long as you have enough for your recipe.
You can also mix and match injector tiers, meaning if you have a mix of Basic and Wyvern injectors you can still do Wyvern crafting as long as you only use the Wyvern injectors for those recipes.

The last thing you will need to do is supply power to the crafting injectors.
The amount of power required will depend on the current recipe, but all Injectors used by a recipe require power.
