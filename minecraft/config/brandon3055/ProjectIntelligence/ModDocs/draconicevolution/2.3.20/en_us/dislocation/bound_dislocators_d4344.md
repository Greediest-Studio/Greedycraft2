The bound dislocator is a special type of dislocator that allows teleportation between dynamic end points.

This dislocator has 2 variants: Point to Point and Player. Point to Point, as the name suggests, allows you to teleport between 2 points. When you create a point to point dislocator, you first have to right-click it to split it into a bound pair. You can use ether dislocator to teleport to the other. This works if the bound dislocator is in a pedestal, portal, in a players inventory or even on the ground as an item entity. This dislocator can be especially useful for things like frame quarries because it allows you to have a dislocator bound to your quarry.

As for the player type, right-clicking this dislocator will bind it to yourself. Another player or entity can then use that dislocator to teleport to your location as long as you are online.
