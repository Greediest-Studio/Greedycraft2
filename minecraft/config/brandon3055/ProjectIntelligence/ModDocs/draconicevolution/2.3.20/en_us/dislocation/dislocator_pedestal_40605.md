You have figured out how to create a simple pedestal on which you can place your Basic or Advanced Dislocators.

Simply right-click with a dislocator in your hand to place it on the pedestal, then right-click the pedestal to teleport.

The advantage of this is that the dislocators won't take damage or use fuel. The disadvantage is you cannot bring them with you to your destination.

To remove the dislocator from the pedestal, simply hold shift and right-click with an empty hand.

When it is holding a Basic Dislocator that has been renamed in an anvil or an Advanced Dislocator with a destination set, either the name or destination will be displayed above the pedestal respectively.

If you hold shift, all names will be hidden except the one you are looking at. (Shift behavior can be reversed in the config, if desired.)
