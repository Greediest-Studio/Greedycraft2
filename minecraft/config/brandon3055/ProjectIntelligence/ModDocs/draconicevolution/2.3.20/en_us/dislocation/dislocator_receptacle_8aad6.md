Like Obsidian, Infused Obsidian can be used to create a magical portal, just with some key differences. This portal can be any shape and any size between 1x1 and 150x150 blocks. By using a dislocator to set the destination, this portal can send you to any location!

When building a portal, the only restriction is it must be a 2-dimensional structure. The shape can be anything you like, as long as the internal area is a complete loop.  Replace any block in the structure with a Dislocator Receptacle so that 1 side of the receptacle is touching the portal area (It can also be in a corner)

To activate the portal, simply right-click the Receptacle with a Basic or Advanced Dislocator that is bound to a location.

You can also pipe Dislocators in and out of the Receptacle with hoppers or other methods of automation.

It is possible to hide the Dislocator Receptacle by right-clicking it with a piece of infused obsidian.

The portal will also respond to a redstone signal. By default, the portal will activate when a dislocator is inserted. When powered by redstone, however, the portal will become redstone dependent.

While powered by redstone, the dislocator is locked in the receptacle.
