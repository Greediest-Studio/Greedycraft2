##### §nDraconic Additions§n

Draconic Evolution's Little Brother!
§rule{colour:0x606060,height:3,width:100%,bottom_pad:4}
Draconic Additions expands Draconic Evolution in a few ways; it aims to allow the player to acquire some DE gear earlier on without breaking the game or the bank, while pushing the limits of your post-end game to the breaking point!

§a-Even MORE powerful armor§a
DA adds §link[draconicadditions:chaotic_armor]{alt_text:"Chaotic Armor"}, a step even above the highly coveted §link[draconicevolution:draconic_armor]{alt_text:"Draconic Armor"}!  Harnass the power of PURE CHAOS and infuse all the things!  However, don't just think that utilizing chaos this way is going to go smoothly...

§a-Even LESS powerful armor§a
You also get access to armor that's a step below §link[draconicevolution:wyvern_armor]{alt_text:"Wyvern Armor"}.  While it may be obtainable without having to acquire a nether star first, don't think you're invincible just because you have draconic shielding early on!

§a-Extremely Overpowered Tools§a
Can't wait for Draconic Evolution 3 to get your Chaotic toolsets?  Well, DA adds an upgrade to the tool that rules them all; the §link[draconicadditions:chaotic_staff_of_power]{alt_text:"Chaotic Staff of Power"}!  Everything isn't what it seems, though...  Infusing pure chaos into the §link[draconicevolution:draconic_tools/draconic_staff_of_power]{alt_text:"Draconic Staff of Power"} may have some unintended side effects!

§a-Fancy Baubles§a
Draconic Additions adds some new fangled baubles that enhance your §link[draconicevolution:draconic_energy_shield]{alt_text:"shielded armor"} (whatever you end up wearing) or even give you some of DE's armor effects outside of the armor itself!  One notable example of this is adding §link[draconicadditions:inertia_cancellation_ring]{alt_text:"Inertia Cancellation"} to your creative flight no matter what item ends up granting you flight!

§a-New RF Generation Options§a
Have some extra armor lying around from your upgrades or adventures?  Perhaps you picked up WAY too many of them from mobs that randomly dropped them?  Break them down into RF with the §link[draconicadditions:armor_generator]{alt_text:"Armor Generator"}!  Or perhaps get a little more creative and try infusing it with pure §link[draconicadditions:chaotic_generator]{alt_text:"Chaos"}!  Don't think it's any safer to deal with than usual, though...
