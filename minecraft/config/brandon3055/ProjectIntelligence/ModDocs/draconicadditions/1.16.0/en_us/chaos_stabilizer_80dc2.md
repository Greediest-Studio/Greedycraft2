Tired of your new armor and tools being out of control?  Enter the Chaos Stabilizer!  Wait, stabilizing chaos?  Is that even possible?!  Yes, it is.  Do not ask how, just know that it is.  This multiblock structure will help you stabilize the chaos that's running rampant throughout your chaotic gear, causing interference with it's built-in abilities.  It's expensive to craft, but surprisingly efficient once set up.

To get started, craft the Chaos Stabilizer Core and place it down, then build the multiblock structure as shown below.  Once you place the last block, the core will glow and start pulling in anything that isn't nailed down, including you.  At this point, you can toss in any item that contains rampant chaos that needs stabilization.  Any item that doesn't fit the ritual will be tossed away violently from whence it came, so don't worry about accidently tossing in your favorite capacitor bank.  Once complete, the Awakened Draconium Blocks will be consumed as part of the ritual, and your item will pop out, all stabilized and ready to go.  To reset the ritual, simply place 4 more Awakened Draconium Blocks in their respective positions and the ritual will start anew.

##### §4§nWarning!

Do NOT stand too close to the structure while the ritual is active!  The hunger for items that contain Chaos may also pull you in, and if you don't have flight, there's no way out!  Thankfully, if you haven't started the ritual, you can just break the stabilizer with no repercussions.  HOWEVER, if the ritual is ongoing, the Chaos emitted from said ritual WILL suck in and destroy anything and everything nearby that isn't nailed down.  Only Draconic Shielding (and quite a bit of it too), fancy flying, or teleportation will save you from this if you get caught in it!
