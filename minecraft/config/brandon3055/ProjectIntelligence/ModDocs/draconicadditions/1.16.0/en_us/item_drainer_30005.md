This machine extracts RF from any standardized tool/item.

While the name is indeed lame, its functionality is not.  This machine will extract the RF from any item that you put into it, provided it bases itself off of the RedstoneFlux API.  Yes, this means any item, including ones that do not normally allow you to extract RF from them!

It works by using the power of the Awakened Cores directly tied to the generator to create a quantum copy of said item, using the pickaxe as a material base.  Once the copy is made, it attempts to "use" the item, causing all of the energy in the original tool to flow to the copy.  Thus, the tool is drained of power, while the copy holds it all, allowing for the Awakened Cores that created it to directly tap into the energy and send it to other machines.  Once the machine detects that the copy has run out of RF, the quantum link is broken, destroying the copy in the proccess.  This allows you to link another item for extraction, but this process cannot happen again until the Awakened Cores have stabilized enough to create another link.
