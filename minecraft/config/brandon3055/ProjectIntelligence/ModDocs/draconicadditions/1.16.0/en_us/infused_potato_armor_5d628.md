##### §nInfused Potato Armor§n

Infused Potato Armor is the second step to acquiring mid-game draconic shielding.  It's main purpose is to serve as a holder for the potential energy contained within this armor set.  "Why is this useful," you might ask?  "Why not have it to where you craft the Energized Potato Armor directly?"  To this, I'll give you an example.

Imagine that you're exploring the Overworld when you're attacked by zombies.  They come out of the woodworks and slap your precious shield a couple of times before you kill them.  You could have tanked that damage and regenerated it using some food on hand, but oh well.  No harm done, right?  A little while later, you are exploring the Nether and you accedently punch a zombie pigman and anger 8 of them!  Good thing you have those shields, right?  Sure!  They slap you 4-5 times, and suddenly, your armor breaks down into it's components and you're left with no shield!  Your life now depends on whether you can fend off the 3 pigmen that are left with your weapons instead of your shield having your back.

Now, let's imagine this with our Infused Potato Armor instead.

Imagine that you're exploring the Overworld when you're attacked by zombies.  They come out of the woodworks and slap you a couple of times before you kill them.  You tanked that damage and regenerated it using some food on hand, so no real harm done.  A little while later, you are exploring the Nether and you accedently punch a zombie pigman and anger 8 of them!  You quickly take off your armor and slap them with it to transform it, then get those shields online!  They slap you 4-5 times, and your shield holds up until you kill them.  You're left with only 1/4 of your energy, but you survived because your shield had your back.

That's why equiping this armor set and waiting until the right moment is a great idea.  It not only provides at least some protection, but it's also always there for when you need to have some real protection in a jiffy AND doesn't take up any extra slots in your inventory.  Now that's what I call handy!
